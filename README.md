# Testing-Map

A demo version can be accessed at this [link](https://web-production-5557.up.railway.app). This app is built using Folium as map with Flask as web application framework.

Added feature:
- Search bar
- Mini Map with open-street-map layout
- Toogle on and off blocks
- ESRI Satellite layout
- Embedded inteactive plot using Plotly as pop up point
- Table and link as pop up on block polygons

- Functional search bar
